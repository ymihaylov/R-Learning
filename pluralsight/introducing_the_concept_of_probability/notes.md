# Introducing Sets
- Set Theory
- Naive Set Theory
- Axiomatic Set Theory

Set - A well-defined collection of distinct objects
Sets are often illustrated with Venn diagrams

- Empty sets
- Set Union
- Set Intersection
- Set Difference

## Cardinality and Set Complement
Set Cardinality = number of elements in a set
Set Complement = set of elements not contained in A (but contained elsewhere)

## Some Set Laws
- De Morgan's Law
- Distributive Properties

## Experiments and events
Consider an experiment consisting of a single balanced 6-roll die roll
The value rolled is a random variable
- Player rolled a 6
This is simple event; it cannot be docomposed

- Player rolled an even number
Player rolled a 2,4 or 6
This is complex event: it can be decomposed into simpler events

## Sample space
The set of all possible values of a random variable is called the sample space
The sample space of for a die roll is:
S = {E<sup>1</sup>, E<sup>2</sup>, E<sup>3</sup>, E<sup>4</sup>, E<sup>5</sup>, E<sup>6</sup>}
where E<sup>n</sup> is an event when n is rolled
Each element of the sample space is a sample point

## Operations on Events

## Independence of Events
If events dont influence on another, the are called idnependent.
- Succesive die rolls or coin flips
If subsequent events influence one another, the are dependent
- Colored balls being pulled out of a hat without replacement
- The set of possible balls gets reduced as you pull them out
