Probability theory

Probability is measured on a scale of 0 to 1.
If an event is impossible, it has a probability of 0
If ts an absolute certainty, then the probability is 1.

Probability of event A
P(A) = n(A) (number of ways getting an event A) / n(S) - the number of pissible outcomes
S - possibility space or sample space (пространство)

Visualisating with Ven diagram

# Complementary events
P(A') = 1 - P(A)

P(A) = n(A) / n(S) - възможностите да се случи събитието върху всички възможности

Exclusive events and intersecting events
P(Red) and P(Black) are mutually exclusive
P(Black) and P(Even) are not mutually exclusive events
Its possible thats both black and even events

If A + B = 1, then A and B are said to be exhaustive. They make up the whole of S. They exhaust all possibilities.

If events A and B are exclusive then
P(A U B) = 0

if events A
